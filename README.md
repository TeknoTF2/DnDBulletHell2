# Bullet Hell D&D Game

A browser-based multiplayer bullet hell game for D&D campaigns! Instead of rolling dice, players dodge attacks in real-time.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Customizable Grid**: Create any grid size for your battlefield
- **Multiplayer**: Players connect and appear as tokens on the grid in real-time
- **Movement System**: Arrow key controls with a speed-based movement system
  - Each player has a "speed" value (tiles they can move per 6 seconds)
  - After moving, remaining speed decreases
  - Speed fully regenerates every 6 seconds
- **Hit Tracking**: Tracks how many times each player gets hit by attacks

### Customization
- **Custom Tokens**: Upload images for player tokens
- **Background Images**: Set a background image that resizes with the grid
- **Player Names**: Each player can set their own name
- **Speed Adjustment**: DM can modify each player's movement speed

### DM Attack System
- **Pattern Creation**: Click grid squares to create attack patterns
- **Timing Controls**: Set individual timing for each square in a pattern
  - All squares can trigger at once (timing = 0)
  - Stagger squares (e.g., 0s, 1s, 2s for sequential)
  - Complex patterns (e.g., 0s, 0s, 2s, 5s for grouped timing)
- **Attack Phases**:
  - Orange warning (1 second) - shows where attack will hit
  - Red damage (3 seconds) - players in these squares get hit
- **Saved Patterns**: Save and reuse patterns throughout the session

## Tips

### Creating Good Attack Patterns
- Use timing to create "waves" of attacks
- Mix simultaneous and sequential squares
- Create safe zones then eliminate them with delayed squares
- Test patterns before using them in important moments

### For Players
- Don't waste all your speed at once
- Plan your movement path ahead
- Watch your speed regeneration timer
- Communicate with other players to avoid collision confusion
